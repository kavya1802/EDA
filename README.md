📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Churn Modelling
📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a customer Churn Modelling dataset to understand customer behavior and identify factors influencing churn.
The analysis uses Python libraries for data cleaning, visualization, and insight generation.
